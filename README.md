# awesome-knowledge

A curated list of knowledge resources of all the things I like: tech and coding, linguistics, graphics, music ...
It is not meant to be an exhaustive list for the public, but just a list of what I like to consume in my profession and free time.

## Coding

## Linguistics, languages, phonetics, ...

I love foreign languages, their history, their comparisons, and diving in the phonetics which in a sense is the music of speaking.

### YouTube

* [NativLang](https://www.youtube.com/user/NativLang) is also rich in content about languages; it leans also sometimes a bit towards more pecualiar and technical stuff and has very interesting language history videos
