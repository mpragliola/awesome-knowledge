# awesome-knowledge

A curated list of knowledge resources of all the things I like: tech and coding, linguistics, graphics, music ...
It is not meant to be an exhaustive list for the public, but just a list of what I like to consume in my profession and free time.

## Coding

## Linguistics, languages, phonetics, ...

I love foreign languages, their history, their comparisons, and diving in the phonetics which in a sense is the music of speaking.
